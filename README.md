The data is available in 8 csv files:

1.customers.csv <br />
2.sellers.csv <br />
3.order_items.csv <br />
4.geolocation.csv <br />
5.payments.csv <br />
6.reviews.csv <br />
7.orders.csv <br />
8.products.csv <br />

##  Import the dataset and do usual exploratory analysis steps like checking the structure & characteristics of the dataset: <br />
Data type of all columns in the "customers" table. <br />
Get the time range between which the orders were placed. <br />
Count the Cities & States of customers who ordered during the given period. <br />
## In-depth Exploration:
Is there a growing trend in the no. of orders placed over the past years?<br />
Can we see some kind of monthly seasonality in terms of the no. of orders being placed?<br />
During what time of the day, do the Brazilian customers mostly place their orders? (Dawn, Morning, Afternoon or Night)<br />
0-6 hrs : Dawn <br />
7-12 hrs : Mornings <br />
13-18 hrs : Afternoon <br />
19-23 hrs : Night <br />
## Evolution of E-commerce orders in the Brazil region:
Get the month on month no. of orders placed in each state. <br />
How are the customers distributed across all the states? <br />
## Impact on Economy: Analyze the money movement by e-commerce by looking at order prices, freight and others.
Get the % increase in the cost of orders from year 2017 to 2018 (include months between Jan to Aug only). <br />
You can use the "payment_value" column in the payments table to get the cost of orders. <br />
Calculate the Total & Average value of order price for each state. <br />
Calculate the Total & Average value of order freight for each state. <br />
## Analysis based on sales, freight and delivery time. <br />
Find the no. of days taken to deliver each order from the orderâ€™s purchase date as delivery time. <br />
Also, calculate the difference (in days) between the estimated & actual delivery date of an order. <br />
Find out the top 5 states with the highest & lowest average freight value.<br />
Find out the top 5 states with the highest & lowest average delivery time.<br />
Find out the top 5 states where the order delivery is really fast as compared to the estimated date of delivery.<br />
You can use the difference between the averages of actual & estimated delivery date to figure out how fast the delivery was for each state.
Analysis based on the payments:<br />
Find the month on month no. of orders placed using different payment types.<br />
Find the no. of orders placed on the basis of the payment installments that have been paid.<br />
